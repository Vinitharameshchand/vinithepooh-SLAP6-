      <p>I learned to measure my days by the way light settles on things.</p>

      <p>
        There are mornings when the world is a cool, quiet bowl — mist settling over the valley,
        the distant teeth of the mountains softened by blue haze.
      </p>

      <p>
        The trail is honest work. Stones remember rain. Roots remember footsteps.
        I walk alone, not because I am lonely, but because the forest speaks more clearly that way.
      </p>

      <p>
        When I come down, I carry a steadiness in my chest.
        I move through the city without urgency — watching shadows stretch.
      </p>

      <p>
        At home, there is softness. A sleeping cat. A couch warmed by afternoon light.
      </p>

      <p>
        What I am learning is not speed, nor certainty.
        It is presence.
